This is a repo to store files and source code needed to compile corbit, by Patrick Powns.
corbit is a C++ port of the QB version of orbit, perpetrated by the dmags, while involved in OCESS (spacesim.org).
corbit is a 2D flight simulator that will be used to simulate the solar system and a ship or two, and can be easily expanded.
